## Abstract
AI should be embedded at the firmware level, with the cloud acting as a library of algorithms.

## Problem
Devices today depend heavily on centralized AI, creating risks of surveillance and monopolization.

## Framework
Borrow–Execute–Erase: devices borrow models from the cloud, execute locally, then erase them.

## Implications
This design reduces dependency, respects privacy, and optimizes ecological impact.

## References
Notes from my thesis and early prototypes.
